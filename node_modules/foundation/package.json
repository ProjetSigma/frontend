  "readme": "\n## This is the [Stylus](https://github.com/learnboost/stylus) port of the Zurb Foundation framework\nYou may also want to checkout:\n\n* [generator-foundation](https://github.com/blai/generator-foundation) for a quick way to generate custom Foundation themes.\n* [fashionista.js](https://github.com/blai/fashionista) for an easy way to decorate your express.js apps using your custom Foundation themes.\n\nWelcome to Foundation\n=====================\n\nFoundation is the most advanced responsive front-end framework in the world. You can quickly prototype and build sites or apps that work on any kind of device with Foundation, which includes layout constructs (like a fully responsive grid), elements and best practices.\n\nHomepage:      http://foundation.zurb.com<br />\nDocumentation: http://foundation.zurb.com/docs<br />\nDownload:      http://foundation.zurb.com/download.php\n\nFoundation is MIT-licensed and absolutely free to use. Foundation wouldn't be possible without the support of the entire ZURB team, our friends and colleagues who gave feedback, and some luminaries who did some heavy lifting that we took advantage of (thanks guys).\n\nRepo Contents\n=============\n\n* Base Source and Compilation Files for SCSS\n* Docs\n* README\n\nZURB\n====\n\nFoundation was made by [ZURB](http://www.zurb.com), a product design company in Campbell, CA.\n\nIf Foundation knocks your socks off the way we hope it does and you want more, why not check out [our jobs](http://www.zurb.com/talent)?\n\nCommunity\n=========\n\nMany thanks to all the people working on Foundation either to improve the base code or to support specific frameworks.
