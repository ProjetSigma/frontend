Prototype of a CLI for Angular 2 applications based on the [ember-cli](http://www.ember-cli.com/) project.

## Note

This project is very much still a work in progress.

The CLI is now in beta.
If you wish to collaborate while the project is still young, check out [our issue list](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues).

## Webpack update

We changed the build system between beta.10 and beta.14, from SystemJS to Webpack.
And with it comes a lot of benefits.
To take advantage of these, your app built with the old beta will need to migrate.

You can update your `beta.10` projects to `beta.14` by following [these instructions](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/Upgrading-from-Beta.10-to-Beta.14).

## Prerequisites

The generated project has dependencies that require **Node 4.x.x and NPM 3.x.x**.

## Installation

**BEFORE YOU INSTALL:** please read the [prerequisites](#prerequisites)
```bash
npm install -g angular-cli
```

## Usage

```bash
ng --help
```

### Generating and serving an Angular2 project via a development server

```bash
ng new PROJECT_NAME
cd PROJECT_NAME
ng serve
```
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

You can configure the default HTTP port and the one used by the LiveReload server with two command-line options :

```bash
ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4201 --live-reload-port 49153
```

### Generating Components, Directives, Pipes and Services

You can use the `ng generate` (or just `ng g`) command to generate Angular components:

```bash
ng generate component my-new-component
ng g component my-new-component # using the alias

# components support relative path generation
# if in the directory src/app/feature/ and you run
ng g component new-cmp
# your component will be generated in src/app/feature/new-cmp
# but if you were to run
ng g component ../newer-cmp
# your component will be generated in src/app/newer-cmp
```
You can find all possible blueprints in the table below:

Scaffold  | Usage
---       | ---
Component | `ng g component my-new-component`
Directive | `ng g directive my-new-directive`
Pipe      | `ng g pipe my-new-pipe`
Service   | `ng g service my-new-service`
Class     | `ng g class my-new-class`
Interface | `ng g interface my-new-interface`
Enum      | `ng g enum my-new-enum`
Module    | `ng g module my-module`

### Generating a route

Generating routes in the CLI has been disabled for the time being. A new router and new route generation blueprints are coming.

You can read the official documentation for the new Router here: https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/router.html. Please note that even though route generation is disabled, building your projects with routing is still fully supported.

### Creating a build

```bash
ng build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Build Targets and Environment Files

`ng build` can specify both a build target (`--target=production` or `--target=development`) and an
environment file to be used with that build (`--environment=dev` or `--environment=prod`).
By default, the development build target and environment are used.

The mapping used to determine which environment file is used can be found in `angular-cli.json`:

```
"environments": {
  "source": "environments/environment.ts",
  "dev": "environments/environment.ts",
  "prod": "environments/environment.prod.ts"
}
```

These options also apply to the serve command. If you do not pass a value for `environment`,
it will default to `dev` for `development` and `prod` for `production`.

```bash
# these are equivalent
ng build --target=production --environment=prod
ng build --prod --env=prod
ng build --prod
# and so are these
ng build --target=development --environment=dev
ng build --dev --e=dev
ng build --dev
ng build
```

You can also add your own env files other than `dev` and `prod` by doing the following:
- create a `src/environments/environment.NAME.ts`
- add `{ "NAME": 'src/environments/environment.NAME.ts' }` to the the `apps[0].environments` object in `angular-cli.json`
- use them via the `--env=NAME` flag on the build/serve commands.

### Base tag handling in index.html

When building you can modify base tag (`<base href="/">`) in your index.html with `--base-href your-url` option.

```bash
# Sets base tag href to /myUrl/ in your index.html
ng build --base-href /myUrl/
ng build --bh /myUrl/
```

### Bundling

All builds make use of bundling, and using the `--prod` flag in  `ng build --prod`
or `ng serve --prod` will also make use of uglifying and tree-shaking functionality.

### Running unit tests

```bash
ng test
```

Tests will execute after a build is executed via [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html), and it will automatically watch your files for changes. You can run tests a single time via `--watch=false`.

### Running end-to-end tests

```bash
ng e2e
```

Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

End-to-end tests are run via [Protractor](https://angular.github.io/protractor/).

### Proxy To Backend
Using the proxying support in webpack's dev server we can highjack certain urls and send them to a backend server.
We do this by passing a file to `--proxy-config`

Say we have a server running on `http://localhost:3000/api` and we want all calls th `http://localhost:4200/api` to go to that server.

We create a file next to projects `package.json` called `proxy.conf.json`
with the content

```
{
  "/api": {
    "target": "http://localhost:3000",
    "secure": false
  }
}
```

You can read more about what options are available here [webpack-dev-server proxy settings](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html#proxy)

and then we edit the `package.json` file's start script to be

```
"start": "ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json",
```

now run it with `npm start`

### Deploying the app via GitHub Pages

You can deploy your apps quickly via:

```
ng github-pages:deploy --message "Optional commit message"
```

This will do the following:

- creates GitHub repo for the current project if one doesn't exist
- rebuilds the app in production mode at the current `HEAD`
- creates a local `gh-pages` branch if one doesn't exist
- moves your app to the `gh-pages` branch and creates a commit
- edit the base tag in index.html to support github pages
- pushes the `gh-pages` branch to github
- returns back to the original `HEAD`

Creating the repo requires a token from github, and the remaining functionality
relies on ssh authentication for all git operations that communicate with github.com.
To simplify the authentication, be sure to [setup your ssh keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/).

If you are deploying a [user or organization page](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/), you can instead use the following command:

```
ng github-pages:deploy --user-page --message "Optional commit message"
```

This command pushes the app to the `master` branch on the github repo instead
of pushing to `gh-pages`, since user and organization pages require this.


### Linting and formatting code

You can lint your app code by running `ng lint`.
This will use the `lint` npm script that in generated projects uses `tslint`.

You can modify the these scripts in `package.json` to run whatever tool you prefer.

### Support for offline applications

**The `--mobile` flag has been disabled temporarily. Sorry for the inconvenience.**

~~Angular-CLI includes support for offline applications via the `--` flag on `ng new`. Support is experimental, please see the angular/mobile-toolkit project and https://mobile.angular.io/ for documentation on how to make use of this functionality.~~

### Commands autocompletion

To turn on auto completion use the following commands:

For bash:
```bash
ng completion >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

For zsh:
```bash
ng completion >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

Windows users using gitbash:
```bash
ng completion >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

### Global styles

The `styles.css` file allows users to add global styles and supports
[CSS imports](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/@import).

If the project is created with the `--style=sass` option, this will be a `.sass`
file instead, and the same applies to `scss/less/styl`.

You can add more global styles via the `apps[0].styles` property in `angular-cli.json`.

### CSS Preprocessor integration

Angular-CLI supports all major CSS preprocessors:
- sass/scss ([http://sass-lang.com/](http://sass-lang.com/))
- less ([http://lesscss.org/](http://lesscss.org/))
- stylus ([http://stylus-lang.com/](http://stylus-lang.com/))

To use these prepocessors simply add the file to your component's `styleUrls`:

```
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: 'app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['app.component.scss']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'app works!';
}
```

When generating a new project you can also define which extention you want for
style files:

```bash
ng new sassy-project --style=sass
```

Or set the default style on an existing project:

```bash
ng set defaults.styleExt scss
```

### 3rd Party Library Installation

Simply install your library via `npm install lib-name --save` and import it in your code.

If the library does not include typings, you can install them using npm:

```bash
npm install d3 --save
npm install @types/d3 --save-dev
```

### Global Library Installation

Some javascript libraries need to be added to the global scope, and loaded as if
they were in a script tag. We can do this using the `apps[0].scripts` and
`apps[0].styles` properties of `angular-cli.json`.

As an example, to use [Boostrap 4](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) this is
what you need to do:

First install Bootstrap from `npm`:

```bash
npm install bootstrap@next
```

Then add the needed script files to `apps[0].scripts`:

```
"scripts": [
  "../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js",
  "../node_modules/tether/dist/js/tether.js",
  "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js"
],
```

Finally add the Bootstrap CSS to the `apps[0].styles` array:
```
"styles": [
  "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css",
  "styles.css"
],
```

Restart `ng serve` if you're running it, and Bootstrap 4 should be working on
your app.

### Updating angular-cli

To update `angular-cli` to a new version, you must update both the global package and your project's local package.

Global package:
```
npm uninstall -g angular-cli
npm cache clean
npm install -g angular-cli@latest
```

Local project package:
```
rm -rf node_modules dist tmp
npm install --save-dev angular-cli@latest
ng init
```

Running `ng init` will check for changes in all the auto-generated files created by `ng new` and allow you to update yours. You are offered four choices for each changed file: `y` (overwrite), `n` (don't overwrite), `d` (show diff between your file and the updated file) and `h` (help).

Carefully read the diffs for each code file, and either accept the changes or incorporate them manually after `ng init` finishes.

**The main cause of errors after an update is failing to incorporate these updates into your code**.

You can find more details about changes between versions in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).


## Known issues

This project is currently a prototype so there are many known issues. Just to mention a few:

- All blueprints/scaffolds are in TypeScript only, in the future blueprints in all dialects officially supported by Angular will be available.
- On Windows you need to run the `build` and `serve` commands with Admin permissions, otherwise the performance is not good.
- The initial installation as well as `ng new` take too long because of lots of npm dependencies.
- Many existing ember addons are not compatible with Angular apps built via angular-cli.
- When you `ng serve` remember that the generated project has dependencies that require **Node 4 or greater**.


## Development Hints for hacking on angular-cli

### Working with master

```bash
git clone https://github.com/angular/angular-cli.git
cd angular-cli
npm link
```

`npm link` is very similar to `npm install -g` except that instead of downloading the package
from the repo, the just cloned `angular-cli/` folder becomes the global package.
Any changes to the files in the `angular-cli/` folder will immediately affect the global `angular-cli` package,
allowing you to quickly test any changes you make to the cli project.

Now you can use `angular-cli` via the command line:

```bash
ng new foo
cd foo
npm link angular-cli
ng serve
```

`npm link angular-cli` is needed because by default the globally installed `angular-cli` just loads
the local `angular-cli` from the project which was fetched remotely from npm.
`npm link angular-cli` symlinks the global `angular-cli` package to the local `angular-cli` package.
Now the `angular-cli` you cloned before is in three places:
The folder you cloned it into, npm's folder where it stores global packages and the `angular-cli` project you just created.

You can also use `ng new foo --link-cli` to automatically link the `angular-cli` package.

Please read the official [npm-link documentation](https://www.npmjs.org/doc/cli/npm-link.html)
and the [npm-link cheatsheet](http://browsenpm.org/help#linkinganynpmpackagelocally) for more information.
